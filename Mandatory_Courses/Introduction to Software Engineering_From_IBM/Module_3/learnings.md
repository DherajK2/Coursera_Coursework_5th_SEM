### 🔑 Key Learnings

This module introduces the essential building blocks of programming, equipping learners with the knowledge needed to begin writing real-world software. Below are the major topics and insights explored in this module.

## 1. 🧱 Basic Programming Constructs  
Programming constructs form the foundation of how software logic is written. The most common include:

- **Variables & Constants:** Used to store and reference data values.
- **Conditionals (if-else):** Allow programs to make decisions based on conditions.
- **Loops (for, while):** Enable repeating a set of instructions multiple times.
- **Functions:** Modular blocks of code that perform specific tasks and improve reusability.

📌 These constructs help break down complex problems into manageable, logical steps.

## 2. 💻 Programming Languages: Types and Usage

Programming languages are categorized based on how they are executed and how close they are to human or machine language:

- **High-Level Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript — readable, platform-independent, and widely used for application development.
- **Low-Level Languages:** Assembly — closely tied to hardware and less abstracted.

Two primary execution types are:

### Interpreted Languages:
- Code is executed line by line using an interpreter.
- More flexible for rapid development and testing.
- Examples: Python, JavaScript.

### Compiled Languages:
- Code is translated into machine language using a compiler before execution.
- Typically faster and more optimized.
- Examples: C, C++, Rust.

## 3. 🔄 Code Planning: Flowcharts & Pseudocode

Before writing real code, developers use **flowcharts** and **pseudocode** to map out logic:

- **Flowcharts:** Visual diagrams using arrows and shapes to represent logic.
- **Pseudocode:** Written in plain English, outlining program logic line by line.

These tools make programs easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

## 4. 🧠 Functions and Code Organization

A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions improve:

- **Modularity:** Break programs into smaller parts.
- **Reusability:** Avoid rewriting code.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to read and debug.

Functions take input (arguments), process data, and return outputs.

## 5. 🧮 Types of Programming Languages

Here’s a breakdown of common types:

| Type                         | Description                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Query Languages              | Used for databases (e.g., SQL).                             |
| Structured Languages         | Follow a top-down logic (e.g., C).                          |
| Object-Oriented Languages    | Based on objects and classes (e.g., Java, Python).          |
| Assembly Language            | Low-level, hardware-specific instructions.                  |

Each type has its own use case, depending on system requirements and performance goals.

## 6. 🔁 Branching and Looping Logic

- **Branching** refers to conditional operations using `if`, `else`, or `switch`.
- **Looping** is about repeating operations using `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loops.

These control the flow of programs and help solve complex repetitive problems with fewer lines of code.

## 🧠 Summary of Module 3

Congratulations on completing this module! You now understand:

- How basic constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions control software logic.
- The difference between interpreted and compiled languages.
- How to use flowcharts and pseudocode to plan code logic before implementation.
- Different categories of programming languages and their appropriate use cases.
- The importance of modular, well-organized code using functions and identifiers.
