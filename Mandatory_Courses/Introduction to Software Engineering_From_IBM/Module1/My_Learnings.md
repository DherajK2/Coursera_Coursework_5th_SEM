## 🧩 Module 1: The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

---

### 🔍 Overview of SDLC

The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is a structured framework that outlines the various stages involved in the development of software. It provides a step-by-step approach to planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications. This framework ensures that software is developed systematically and meets customer expectations.

### 🛠️ Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirements Gathering**  
   Identify and document the goals, features, and constraints of the software. Understand what the client or end-user expects the software to do.

2. **Design**  
   Define the architecture, system components, user interfaces, and data models. This serves as a blueprint for the implementation phase.

3. **Implementation**  
   Write the actual code to create the software based on the design specifications.

4. **Testing**  
   Verify that the software works as intended. Detect and fix any bugs or issues to ensure product quality.

5. **Deployment**  
   Release the software to the end-users in a live environment. Make it accessible for actual use.

6. **Maintenance**  
   Provide ongoing support, updates, and improvements. Fix issues that arise post-deployment and adapt the software to changing needs.

### 🎯 Importance of SDLC

Using a structured SDLC process:

- Ensures **high-quality** software.
- Improves **efficiency** and **project planning**.
- Minimizes **risks** and unexpected issues.
- Enhances **team collaboration** and **communication**.
- Supports **on-time** and **within-budget** delivery of software products.

### 🔄 Models of SDLC

1. **Waterfall Model**  
   A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on. Best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal expected changes.

2. **Agile Model**  
   An iterative and incremental approach. Emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. Ideal for projects where requirements may evolve over time.

3. **Spiral Model**  
   Combines elements of both iterative development and risk management. Designed for large, complex, and high-risk projects where changes are expected and risk needs close monitoring.

### 🧠 Summary

Module 1 introduces the core concept of SDLC, explains its phases, highlights its importance, and compares different models used in practice. This foundation is essential for understanding how software projects are planned, executed, and maintained in real-world scenarios.
