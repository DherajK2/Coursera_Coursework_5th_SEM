# 📘 Introduction to Software Engineering – IBM (Coursera)  
## 🧱 Module 4: Software Architecture, Design, and Patterns

---

### 🧠 Overview

Module 4 focuses on the fundamental aspects of how software systems are structured, designed, and deployed effectively.

- **Software Architecture**: Understand how architecture acts as a blueprint for system structure and behavior.
- **Design Approaches**: Explore structured design, modeling techniques, and the use of UML diagrams.
- **Object-Oriented Principles**: Learn the 4 pillars of OOP — Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Discover reusable solutions to common architecture challenges.
- **Deployment Environments**: Understand how different application environments affect performance and scalability.

### 🏗️ Topics & Explanations

---

### 1. **Introduction to Software Architecture**  
Software architecture defines the blueprint for a system, guiding its structure and interactions among components. A well-designed architecture improves scalability, performance, and maintainability.

### 2. **Software Design and Modeling**  
Modeling simplifies complex systems. UML diagrams like class, interaction, and state diagrams help in planning, communication, and reducing development time.

### 3. **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design**  
OOP provides a framework using objects and classes. Four core pillars help in designing modular, reusable software:

- **Abstraction**: Hides unnecessary details to highlight essential features.

- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods, restricting direct access to internal states.

- **Inheritance**: Enables one class to acquire properties and methods from another.

- **Polymorphism**: Allows different classes to respond to the same function call in different ways.

### 4. **Software Architecture and Design**  
Architecture combines high-level structuring with lower-level design decisions. It affects maintainability, flexibility, and development speed.

---

### 5. **Approaches to Application Architecture**  
Includes monolithic, layered, microservices, and service-oriented architecture (SOA). Each has strengths based on project size, team structure, and scalability needs.

---

### 6. **Architectural Patterns in Software**  
Patterns provide repeatable solutions for common software design challenges:

- **2-tier** and **3-tier**
- **Event-driven**
- **Peer-to-peer**
- **Microservices**

These patterns can be used alone or in combination. However, some are mutually exclusive.

### 7. **Application Deployment Environments**  
Environments include:

- **Development**
- **Testing/QA**
- **Staging**
- **Production**

Each serves a different purpose and prepares the software for a smooth release process. Production environments address critical non-functional aspects like load handling and security.

---

### 8. **Production Deployment Components**  
Key components for robust production deployments:

- Firewalls
- Load balancers
- Web/Application servers
- Proxy servers
- Database servers

They ensure scalability, performance, and security in real-world usage.

### ✅ Summary

By completing this module, you now understand:

- How software architecture acts as the foundation of any software system.
- The significance of structured design and behavioral models in breaking down complex systems.
- UML diagrams such as state transitions, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams.
- The principles of Object-Oriented Programming and how they influence system structure.
- The differences between common architectural patterns and how to use them effectively.
- The stages of deployment from development to production and the infrastructure required for scalable applications.
