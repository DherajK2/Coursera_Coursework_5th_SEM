# Module 1 Learnings: The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking

## The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model

The TCP/IP model has five layers that describe how data travels across networks: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, and Application.

## Supplementary Reading for The OSI Networking Model

The OSI model defines seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. It helps standardize networking functions.

## Alex: Why Networking is Important

Networking enables devices to communicate, share resources, and access the internet, which is essential for modern business and daily life.

## Cables

Cables physically connect devices. Common types include twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic.

## Hubs and Switches

- **Hubs** broadcast data to all devices on a network.
- **Switches** intelligently forward data to the intended device.

## Routers

Routers connect different networks and direct data packets between them.

## Servers and Clients

Servers provide data or services, while clients request and use those services.

## Moving Bits Across the Wire

Data travels as electrical or light signals over cables.

## Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing

Twisted pair cables contain pairs of wires twisted to reduce interference. They support half and full duplex communication.

## Supplemental Reading for Ethernet Over Twisted Pair Technologies

Ethernet over twisted pair is the most common cabling for LANs and internet connections in homes and businesses.

## UTP, STP, and FTP Ethernet Cables

- **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):** Basic protection, widely used.
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):** Extra shielding for noisy environments.
- **FTP (Foiled Twisted Pair):** Foil shielding for interference reduction.

## Straight-through and Crossover Cables

- **Straight-through cables** connect different devices (e.g., PC to switch).
- **Crossover cables** connect similar devices (e.g., PC to PC).

## Network Ports and Patch Panels

Patch panels organize and manage multiple network ports in one location.

## Cabling Tools

Common cabling tools include:

- Crimper: crimps connectors onto cables
- Cable stripper: removes insulation
- Wi-Fi analyzer: scans wireless signals
- Toner probe: traces cables
- Punch down tool: inserts wires into patch panels
- Cable tester: checks cable integrity
- Loopback plug: tests ports
- Network tap: copies traffic for monitoring

## Ethernet and MAC Addresses

MAC addresses uniquely identify devices on a local network.

## Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast

- **Unicast:** Data sent to one device.
- **Multicast:** Data sent to a group.
- **Broadcast:** Data sent to all devices on a LAN.

## Dissecting an Ethernet Frame

An Ethernet frame includes destination and source MAC addresses, EtherType, payload, and frame check sequence for error detection.
